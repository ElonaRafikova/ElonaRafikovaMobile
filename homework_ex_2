1.	I setup project that has been discussed in the class. Both tests (native and web) run successfully.

2.	For existing native mobile autotest I tried to use other locators:
•	driver.findElementByXPath("//android.widget.Button[@content-desc='Add Contact']")
•	driver.findElement(By.className("android.widget.Button"))

 I defined these locators using Appium Inspector. There were not any differences with id version. 

3.	I modified existing tests to run on a real device. For this capability “deviceName” should be changed. It can be changed in that way:

capabilities.setCapability("deviceName","serial_number_of_device")

4.	I connected a real device to Appium and run tests with these steps:
•	Enable development options on device
•	Enable “USB debugging” 
•	Set “USB configuration” to MTP
•	Connect device to computer by USB 
•	Open command-line terminal
•	Use adb devices to verify connection
•	Get number of device and set it in capability “deviceName” in test
•	Run Appium server
•	Build project with Maven 
•	Run test with Idea’s menu
The only difference was with native test. In ContactManager app there were contacts from my device and in emulator the list was clear.

5.	What should be changed in project in my opinion – why – and how: 
•	No checks – now it’s not tests – include checks 
•	Hardcoded values – make tests hard to support – put properties in proprieties file
•	Thread sleep – tests is real-time – remove thread sleep 
•	Absolute paths – make tests non-portable – put properties in proprieties file
•	Structure – all together (for example setup with tests in test directory) – put setup in src\java, different test for native and web in src\test
