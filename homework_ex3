1.	Rewrite (complete) Driver using “singleton” pattern. Are there any advantages?
    •	I rewrote Driver using “singleton” pattern. The main advantage of having one instance of driver is 
      that we can easily manage it. We can be sure that we close, open, modified needed instance of driver.
  
2.	Suggest improvements for .properties reading. What are the purposes?
    •	Except using two different files native.properties and web.properties, we can make TestProperties.class not parent 
      of Driver.class but field in Driver.class for encapsulation. Also we can move code with setting 
      desired capabilities from Driver.class to TestProperties.class, and in Driver.class leave only initialization of driver. 
      Thus, we will have logic related to properties in TestProperties.class.
      
  
3.	Add checks of other fields and their titles (Contact Name, Contact phone) in “native” test
    •	I added checks of fields and titles in “native” test.

4.	Optional: Add keyboard presence check  in “native” test.

5.	Which checks would you place in the “web” test?
    •	I would place checks of logo, main text under logo, availability of three panels, headers of these panels.

6.	Implement checks for “web” test in code and try to use
    •	I implemented these checks and run the tests.
