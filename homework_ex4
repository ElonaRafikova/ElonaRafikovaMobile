1.	Add support of appPackage and appActivity parameters for Android devices 
(reading from a .properties file and then setting in the DesiredCapabilities). 
Locally installed Appium DT has no need in these parameters, but for Appium server of Minsk Mobile Farm it’s mandatory.
    Parameters added.
    a.	Or try to use autoLaunch capability with app as before. Does this approach work?
        No, this approach doesn't work for me.
2.	Change settings to run web test on a certain iOS device on Mobile Test Farm. Run test with your changes. 
    Did test pass?
    Yes, test passed 
3.	Change settings to run native test on a certain/random Android device on Mobile Test Farm. Run test with your changes. 
    Did test pass?
    Yes, test passed 
4.	What’s wrong with our code? How to fix/improve it? Implement your suggestions.
    Firstly, I remove all hardcoded strings to enums of fields.
    Secondly, I moved TestProperties.class from parent to field of Driver.class and made all reading properties in TestProperties. 
    And in Driver.class leave initialisation with capabilities that TestPropeties provide.
